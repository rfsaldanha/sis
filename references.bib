  abstract = {The central theme of this article is the character and causes of long-term changes in the personal distribution of income in the U.S. Various aspects in this field of study has been plagued by looseness in definitions, unusual scarcity of data, and pressures of strongly held opinions. While it is not possible to completely avoid the resulting difficulties, it may help to specify the characteristics of the size-of-income distributions. Five specifications may be listed. First, units for which incomes are recorded and grouped should be family-expenditure units, properly adjusted for the number of persons in each. Second, the distribution should be complete in the sense that, it covers all units in a country rather than a segment either at the upper or lower tail. Third, if possible those units should be segregated whose main income earners are either still in the learning or already in the retired stages of their life cycle. Fourth, income should be defined for national income in the U.S. Fifth, these units should be grouped by secular levels of income, free of cyclical and other transient disturbances.},

Objective This study aimed to build a cross-border surveillance system that can make comparable and qualified data available to all parties involved in malaria control between French Guiana and Brazil. Methods Data reconciliation rules based on expert knowledge were defined and applied to the heterogeneous data provided by the existing malaria surveillance systems of both countries. Visualization dashboards were designed to facilitate progressive data exploration, analysis, and interpretation. Dedicated advanced open source and robust software solutions were chosen to facilitate solution sharing and reuse. Results A database gathering the harmonized data on cross-border malaria epidemiology is updated monthly with new individual malaria cases from both countries. Online dashboards permit a progressive and user-friendly visualization of raw data and epidemiological indicators, in the form of time series, maps, and data quality indexes. The monitoring system was shown to be able to identify changes in time series that are related to control actions, as well as differentiated changes according to space and to population subgroups. Conclusions This cross-border monitoring tool could help produce new scientific evidence on cross-border malaria dynamics, implementing cross-border cooperation for malaria control and elimination, and can be quickly adapted to other cross-border contexts.},

  abstract = {Background: In 2017, inhabitants along the border between French Guiana and Brazil were affected by a malaria outbreak primarily due to Plasmodium vivax (Pv). While malaria cases have steadily declined between 2005 and 2016 in this Amazonian region, a resurgence was observed in 2017. Methods: Two investigations were performed according to different spatial scales and information details: (1) a local study on the French Guiana border, which enabled a thorough investigation of malaria cases treated at a local village health center and the entomological circumstances in the most affected neighborhood, and (2) a regional and cross-border study, which enabled exploration of the regional spatiotemporal epidemic dynamic. Number and location of malaria cases were estimated using French and Brazilian surveillance systems. Results: On the French Guianese side of the border in Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, the attack rate was 5.5\% (n = 4000), reaching 51.4\% (n = 175) in one Indigenous neighborhood. Entomological findings suggest a peak of Anopheles darlingi density in August and September. Two female An. darlingi (n = 1104, 0.18\%) were found to be Pv-positive during this peak. During the same period, aggregated data from passive surveillance conducted by Brazilian and French Guianese border health centers identified 1566 cases of Pv infection. Temporal distribution during the 2007-2018 period displayed seasonal patterns with a peak in November 2017. Four clusters were identified among epidemic profiles of cross-border area localities. All localities of the first two clusters were Brazilian. The localization of the first cluster suggests an onset of the outbreak in an Indigenous reservation, subsequently expanding to French Indigenous neighborhoods and non-Native communities. Conclusions: The current findings demonstrate a potential increase in malaria cases in an area with otherwise declining numbers. This is a transborder region where human mobility and remote populations challenge malaria control programs. This investigation illustrates the importance of international border surveillance and collaboration for malaria control, particularly in Indigenous villages and mobile populations.},

This study evaluates the feasibility of using such harmonized data to build a cross-border early warning system. To this end, the study compared ARIMAX and LSTM approaches. Time-lagged meteorological data were introduced to improve the forecasts. LSTM outperformed ARIMAX, with a 10 to 39\% decrease of Mean Absolute and Root Means Square Errors, and better predicted low case numbers. Meteorological data improved significantly model predictions, by considering time-lags from 3 to 7 weeks compatible with the knowledge found in the literature. This study demonstrated the feasibility of building a cross-border malaria early warning system, that would significantly contribute to malaria control and elimination.},

  abstract = {Background: Political, economic, and epidemiological changes in Brazil have affected health and the health system. We used the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016) results to understand changing health patterns and inform policy responses. Methods: We analysed GBD 2016 estimates for life expectancy at birth (LE), healthy life expectancy (HALE), all-cause and cause-specific mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and risk factors for Brazil, its 26 states, and the Federal District from 1990 to 2016, and compared these with national estimates for ten comparator countries. Findings: Nationally, LE increased from 68{$\cdot$}4 years (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 68{$\cdot$}0--68{$\cdot$}9) in 1990 to 75{$\cdot$}2 years (74{$\cdot$}7--75{$\cdot$}7) in 2016, and HALE increased from 59{$\cdot$}8 years (57{$\cdot$}1--62{$\cdot$}1) to 65{$\cdot$}5 years (62{$\cdot$}5--68{$\cdot$}0). All-cause age-standardised mortality rates decreased by 34{$\cdot$}0\% (33{$\cdot$}4--34{$\cdot$}5), while all-cause age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 30{$\cdot$}2\% (27{$\cdot$}7--32{$\cdot$}8); the magnitude of declines varied among states. In 2016, ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of age-standardised YLLs, followed by interpersonal violence. Low back and neck pain, sense organ diseases, and skin diseases were the main causes of YLDs in 1990 and 2016. Leading risk factors contributing to DALYs in 2016 were alcohol and drug use, high blood pressure, and high body-mass index. Interpretation: Health improved from 1990 to 2016, but improvements and disease burden varied between states. An epidemiological transition towards non-communicable diseases and related risks occurred nationally, but later in some states, while interpersonal violence grew as a health concern. Policy makers can use these results to address health disparities. Funding: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation and the Brazilian Ministry of Health.},

It is believed that under-reporting is a relevant factor in determining the actual mortality rate and, if not considered, can cause significant misinformation. Therefore, this work aims to estimate the under-reporting of cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Brazilian states using data from the InfoGripe. InfoGripe targets notifications of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). The methodology is based on the combination of data analytics (event detection methods) and time series modeling (inertia and novelty concepts) over hospitalized SARI cases. The estimate of real cases of the disease, called novelty, is calculated by comparing the difference in SARI cases in 2020 (after COVID-19) with the total expected cases in recent years (2016--2019). The expected cases are derived from a seasonal exponential moving average. The results show that under-reporting rates vary significantly between states and that there are no general patterns for states in the same region in Brazil. The states of Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso have the highest rates of under-reporting of cases. The rate of under-reporting of deaths is high in the Rio Grande do Sul and the Minas Gerais. This work can be highlighted for the combination of data analytics and time series modeling. Our calculation of under-reporting rates based on SARI is conservative and better characterized by deaths than for cases.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Our objective is to describe the differences in the sampling plans of the two editions of the Brazilian National Health Survey (PNS 2013 and 2019) and to evaluate how the changes affected the coefficient of variation (CV) and the design effect (Deff) of some estimated indicators. Variables from different parts of the questionnaire were analyzed to cover proportions with different magnitudes. The prevalence of obesity was included in the analysis since anthropometry measurement in the 2019 survey was performed in a subsample. The value of the point estimate, CV, and the Deff were calculated for each indicator, considering the stratification of the primary sampling units, the weighting of the sampling units, and the clustering effect. The CV and the Deff were lower in the 2019 estimates for most indicators. Concerning the questionnaire indicators of all household members, the Deffs were high and reached values greater than 18 for having a health insurance plan. Regarding the indicators of the individual questionnaire, for the prevalence of obesity, the Deff ranged from 2.7 to 4.2, in 2013, and from 2.7 to 10.2, in 2019. The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes per Federative Unit had a higher CV and lower Deff. Expanding the sample size to meet the diverse health objectives and the high Deff are significant challenges for developing probabilistic household-based national survey. New probabilistic sampling strategies should be considered to reduce costs and clustering effects.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The Data Science Platform Applied to Health (PCDaS) is a research and technological development project that aims to develop and apply novel data analysis methods to public health data. It fills a technological gap between the variety of data sources available in legacy and unstandardized formats and the current needs and possibilities of Data Science applications to consume and explore data for the benefit of the Brazilian Health System. PCDaS provides democratic access to health-related datasets and information by requiring fewer technological abilities from its users while maintaining a continuously updated stack of technologies. As a data ecosystem, our primary goal is to provide secure and remote access to health data, technological tools, and a robust infrastructure provided by our platform to process and analyze a large amount of data that generally demand computational power often unavailable to researchers. The infrastructure consists of multi-region on-premise and cloud servers prepared to deal with the heavy analysis of Big Data from anywhere from multiple users simultaneously. Providing secure and remote access to health databases, whether in their original form or processed, is a daily breakthrough for a public health researcher. Knowing that there is a place where they can access integrated data in a standard format makes the research process much more manageable. To ensure quality, our data engineering and governance teams process these data sources following a gold standard based on cross-tables provided by the Health Ministry (the TabNET system) and decoding the original variables into meaningful names provided by the sources. It is very relevant to emphasize the comprehensive documentation of metadata, attributes, and the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for databases. Every part of these steps is described in detail on the PCDaS website, ensuring the comprehension and reproducibility of the process. These features ensure that PCDaS users can effectively leverage the platform's resources and capabilities, enabling them to conduct research, perform data analysis, and collaborate within a secure and supportive environment to contribute to the Brazilian Health System.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Concerns about the increasing impact of severe COVID-19 in younger individuals in Brazil came after a recent synchronised country-wide wave of cases in Brazil. This communication analyses how hospitalisations due to COVID-19 changed in the age groups 18--49 years and {$\geq$}70 years. Study design: Longitudinal study based on secondary data. Methods: Data from SIVEP-Gripe, a public and open-access database of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness records (including COVID-19 notifications), were used in this study. Statistical control charts examined changes in the magnitude and variation of younger (18--49 years) and older ({$\geq$}70 years) adults who were hospitalised between 15th March 2020 and 19th June 2021. Results: During the few first weeks of the pandemic in Brazil, the number of COVID-19 hospitalisations increased in older adults but decreased in younger adults. Subsequently, hospitalisations reached statistical control zones in epidemiological weeks (EW) 19--48 of 2020 (EW 19-48/2020) and EW 03-05/2021 (18--49 y, mean = 26.1\%; {$\geq$}70 y, mean = 32.8\%). Between EW 49/2020 and EW 02/2021, the number of hospitalisations of younger adults dropped to levels below the lower control limit. In contrast, the number of hospitalisations of older adults surpassed the upper limit of the corresponding statistical control zones. However, from EW 06/2021, numbers of hospitalisations changed from statistical control zones, with hospitalisations of younger adults increasing and reaching 44.9\% in EW 24/2021 and hospitalisations of older adults decreasing until EW 19/2021 (14.1\%) and reaching 17.3\% in EW 24/2021. Conclusions: An increasing number of COVID-19 hospitalisations were observed in younger adults from EW 06/2021. This could be a result of the successful vaccination programme in older adults, who were initially prioritised, and possibly an increased exposure to highly transmissible variants of COVID-19 in younger adults who had to go to work in the absence of social protection (i.e. government financial support). Potential consequences of COVID-19 hospitalisations in younger adults could include a reduced life expectancy of the population and an increased number of people unable to perform daily activities due to post-COVID-19 conditions.},

The subject is increasingly attracting the attention of health professionals and climate-change scientists, particularly with respect to malaria and other vector-transmitted human diseases. The result has been the emergence of a crisis discipline, reminiscent of the early phases of conservation biology. Latitudinal, altitudinal, seasonal, and interannual associations between climate and disease along with historical and experimental evidence suggest that climate, along with many other factors, can affect infectious diseases in a nonlinear fashion. However, although the globe is significantly warmer than it was a century ago, there is little evidence that climate change has already favored infectious diseases. While initial projections suggested dramatic future increases in the geographic range of infectious diseases, recent models predict range shifts in disease distributions, with little net increase in area. Many factors can affect infectious disease, and some may overshadow the effects of climate.},

  abstract = {Background: Access is central to the performance of health care systems around the world. However, access to health care remains a complex notion as exemplified in the variety of interpretations of the concept across authors. The aim of this paper is to suggest a conceptualisation of access to health care describing broad dimensions and determinants that integrate demand and supply-side-factors and enabling the operationalisation of access to health care all along the process of obtaining care and benefiting from the services. Methods: A synthesis of the published literature on the conceptualisation of access has been performed. The most cited frameworks served as a basis to develop a revised conceptual framework. Results: Here, we view access as the opportunity to identify healthcare needs, to seek healthcare services, to reach, to obtain or use health care services, and to actually have a need for services fulfilled. We conceptualise five dimensions of accessibility: 1) Approachability; 2) Acceptability; 3) Availability and accommodation; 4) Affordability; 5) Appropriateness. In this framework, five corresponding abilities of populations interact with the dimensions of accessibility to generate access. Five corollary dimensions of abilities include: 1) Ability to perceive; 2) Ability to seek; 3) Ability to reach; 4) Ability to pay; and 5) Ability to engage. Conclusions: This paper explains the comprehensiveness and dynamic nature of this conceptualisation of access to care and identifies relevant determinants that can have an impact on access from a multilevel perspective where factors related to health systems, institutions, organisations and providers are considered with factors at the individual, household, community, and population levels.},

Referential analysis of public policies and especially of historical institutionalism was used. Three dimensions sum up the conditioning factors of regionalization: context (historical-structural, political-institutional and conjunctural), directionality (ideology, object, actors, strategies and instruments) and regionalization features (institutionality and governance). The empirical research relied mainly on the analysis of official documents and interviews with key actors in 24 states. Distinct patterns of influence in the states were observed, with regionalization being marked by important gains in institutionality and governance in the period. Nevertheless, inherent difficulties of the contexts prejudice greater advances. There is a pressing need to broaden the territorial focus in government planning and to integrate sectorial policies for medium and long-term regional development in order to empower regionalization and to overcome obstacles to the access to healthcare services in Brazil.},

Methodology: The methodological approach undertaken in the elaboration of this article was qualitative, resulting in a bibliographical analysis of specialized literature captured from the descriptors Brazilian Federalism and Regionalization of Health. Results: The Brazilian federalism introduce dysfunctions and lack of coordinating capacity.

  abstract = {This article addresses the relationship between the reservation of the possible and access to health in the Brazilian context. The reservation of the possible is a legal principle that allows the State to claim financial limitations to guarantee social rights, such as access to health. In this scenario, we seek to analyze how this notion has impacted the effective access to health services in Brazil, considering public policies and the availability of resources for this purpose. Thus, the objective of this study is to investigate how the concept of reservation of the possible has been used as a justification to restrict access to health in Brazil. Thus, it seeks to understand the impacts of the reserve of the possible on vulnerable groups and the most needy populations that depend on the Unified Health System (SUS). The research is based on a qualitative approach, with bibliographic review and documentary analysis. The research results indicate that the reserve of the possible has often been used as a justification for reducing investments in public health in Brazil. This has had negative impacts on access to health services, especially for the most vulnerable groups in society. Judicial decisions have also been influenced by this principle, which can undermine the realization of the constitutionally guaranteed right to health. In addition, public policies have faced financial challenges, affecting the quality and availability of health services offered by the SUS. In conclusion, the relationship between the reservation of the possible and access to health in Brazil is a complex and relevant issue. The principle has been used as a way to justify the scarcity of resources allocated to health, directly impacting the poorest population. The discussion on the reserve of the possible is crucial to improve the Brazilian health system and ensure effective access to essential services to all citizens.},

  abstract = {People in poor countries tend to have less access to health services than those in better-off countries, and within countries, the poor have less access to health services. This article documents disparities in access to health services in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), using a framework incorporating quality, geographic accessibility, availability, financial accessibility, and acceptability of services. Whereas the poor in LMICs are consistently at a disadvantage in each of the dimensions of access and their determinants, this need not be the case. Many different approaches are shown to improve access to the poor, using targeted or universal approaches, engaging government, nongovernmental, or commercial organizations, and pursuing a wide variety of strategies to finance and organize services. Key ingredients of success include concerted efforts to reach the poor, engaging communities and disadvantaged people, encouraging local adaptation, and careful monitoring of effects on the poor. Yet governments in LMICs rarely focus on the poor in their policies or the implementation or monitoring of health service strategies. There are also new innovations in financing, delivery, and regulation of health services that hold promise for improving access to the poor, such as the use of health equity funds, conditional cash transfers, and coproduction and regulation of health services. The challenge remains to find ways to ensure that vulnerable populations have a say in how strategies are developed, implemented, and accounted for in ways that demonstrate improvements in access by the poor.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze flows of travel between place of residence and health care services by children and adolescents with cancer. METHODS: The flows of travel between place of residence and the health care service for children and adolescents receiving care in Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS) were monitored between 2000 and 2007. The unit of analysis was the health care district. The geographical information system data and network methodology, by type of treatment received (chemotherapy and radiotherapy) and hospital admissions were used. RESULTS: The SUS made 465,289 authorizations for chemotherapy, 29,151 for radiotherapy and 383,568 for hospital admissions for the treatment of children and adolescents with a diagnosis of cancer. The dominant flow formed 48 networks for chemotherapy, 53 for radiotherapy and 112 for hospital admissions. Most of the volume of treatment occurred in the health districts of Brazil's 12 largest cities (with strong links between them and each having an extensive area of direct influence accompanying the structure of the Brazilian urban system. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying the networks formed by utilization of SUS facilities providing care for children and adolescents with cancer shows that overall most patients are covered by the existing networks. However, about 10\% of travel occurs outside the dominant structure, indicating the need for alternative regionalization. These results show the importance of planning the distribution of services to meet the population's needs.},

We describe the application of innovative methods based on a social network analysis approach. The findings presented refer to a study carried out between July 2008 and January 2010 in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana. Social network analysis methods were applied in five different districts using the software package Ucinet to calculate the various properties of the social network of eye care providers. The study focused on the managerial decisions made by Ghanaian district hospital managers about the governance of the health system. The study showed that the health system in the Brong Ahafo region experienced significant changes specifically after a key shock, the departure of an international organization. Several other actors at different levels of the network disappeared, the positions of nurses and hospital managers changed, creating new relationships and power balances that resulted in a change in the general structure of the network. The system shifted from a centralized and dense hierarchical network towards an enclaved network composed of five sub-networks. The new structure was less able to respond to shocks, circulate information and knowledge across scales and implement multi-scale solutions than that which it replaced. Although the network became less resilient, it responded better to the management needs of the hospital managers who now had better access to information, even if this information was partial. The change of the network over time also showed the influence of the international organization on generating links and creating connections between actors from different levels. The findings of the study reveal the importance of creating international health connections between actors working in different spatial scales of the health system.},

  abstract = {The past five years have seen a growth in the interest in systems approaches in epidemiologic research. These approaches may be particularly appropriate for social epidemiology. Social network analysis and agent-based models (ABMs) are two approaches that have been used in the epidemiologic literature. Social network analysis involves the characterization of social networks to yield inference about how network structures may influence risk exposures among those in the network. ABMs can promote population-level inference from explicitly programmed, micro-level rules in simulated populations over time and space. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of these models in social epidemiologic research, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Network analysis may be ideal for understanding social contagion, as well as the influences of social interaction on population health. However, network analysis requires network data, which may sacrifice generalizability, and causal inference from current network analytic methods is limited. ABMs are uniquely suited for the assessment of health determinants at multiple levels of influence that may couple with social interaction to produce population health. ABMs allow for the exploration of feedback and reciprocity between exposures and outcomes in the etiology of complex diseases. They may also provide the opportunity for counterfactual simulation. However, appropriate implementation of ABMs requires a balance between mechanistic rigor and model parsimony, and the precision of output from complex models is limited. Social network and agent-based approaches are promising in social epidemiology, but continued development of each approach is needed.},

This can be achieved through better insight into how health systems are structured. Social network analysis can provide an appropriate and innovative paradigm for the health systems researcher, allow new analyses of the structure of health systems, and facilitate understanding of the role of stakeholders within a health system. The social network analysis methodology adapted to health systems research and described in detail by the authors comprises three main stages: (i) describing the set of actors and members of the network; (ii) characterizing the relationships between actors; and (iii) analysing the structure of the systems. Evidence generated through social network analysis could help policy makers to understand how health systems react over time and to better adjust health programmes and innovations to the capacities of health systems in low- and middle-income countries to achieve universal coverage.},

Everyone could observe that this kind of infectious disease often has the ability to cross countries borders and spread rapidly. Preventing, monitoring and controlling the outbreak of these diseases have appeared to be a public health problem of primary importance for years. However, although numerous works have been conducted in order to understand and study epidemics, this subject remains a topical issue because of the complexity of the phenomena. In this paper, we present new opportunities offered by the field of social networks for understanding the spread of infectious diseases. This work focuses both on techniques already used in epidemiology, and very recent works in social network analysis that open new perspectives. We give an overview of methods currently used to model and study the spread of diseases and future directions that the social network approach allows to glimpse.},

Multivariate analysis and network graphical tools are used in a case comparative design to examine public health system network density and organizational centrality in the domains of adolescent health, senior health, and preparedness. Differences associated with public health governance (centralized, decentralized), urbanization (micropolitan, noncore), health status, public health domain, and collaboration area are described. Data Collection/Extraction Methods. Site visit interviews with key informants from local organizations and a web-based survey administered to local stakeholders. Principal Findings. Governance, urbanization, public health domain, and health status are associated with public health system network structures. The centrality of local health departments (LHDs) varies across public health domains and urbanization. Collaboration is greater in assessment, assurance, and advocacy than in seeking funding. Conclusions. If public health system organization is causally related to improved health status, studying individual system components such as LHDs will prove insufficient for studying the impact of public health systems.},

  abstract = {Background               Early warning systems (EWSs) are of increasing importance in the context of outbreak-prone diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, malaria, yellow fever, and Zika. A scoping review has been undertaken for all 5 diseases to summarize existing evidence of EWS tools in terms of their structural and statistical designs, feasibility of integration and implementation into national surveillance programs, and the users' perspective of their applications.                                         Methods               Data were extracted from Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Google Scholar, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), PubMed, Web of Science, and WHO Library Database (WHOLIS) databases until August 2019. Included were studies reporting on (a) experiences with existing EWS, including implemented tools; and (b) the development or implementation of EWS in a particular setting. No restrictions were applied regarding year of publication, language or geographical area.                                         Findings               Through the first screening, 11,710 documents for dengue, 2,757 for Zika, 2,706 for chikungunya, 24,611 for malaria, and 4,963 for yellow fever were identified. After applying the selection criteria, a total of 37 studies were included in this review. Key findings were the following: (1) a large number of studies showed the quality performance of their prediction models but except for dengue outbreaks, only few presented statistical prediction validity of EWS; (2) while entomological, epidemiological, and social media alarm indicators are potentially useful for outbreak warning, almost all studies focus primarily or exclusively on meteorological indicators, which tends to limit the prediction capacity; (3) no assessment of the integration of the EWS into a routine surveillance system could be found, and only few studies addressed the users' perspective of the tool; (4) almost all EWS tools require highly skilled users with advanced statistics; and (5) spatial prediction remains a limitation with no tool currently able to map high transmission areas at small spatial level.                                         Conclusions               In view of the escalating infectious diseases as global threats, gaps and challenges are significantly present within the EWS applications. While some advanced EWS showed high prediction abilities, the scarcity of tool assessments in terms of integration into existing national surveillance systems as well as of the feasibility of transforming model outputs into local vector control or action plans tends to limit in most cases the support of countries in controlling disease outbreaks.},

  abstract = {Early warning system (EWS) for vector-borne diseases is incredibly complex due to numerous factors originating from human, environmental, vector and the disease itself. Dengue EWS aims to collect data that leads to prompt decision-making processes that trigger disease intervention strategies to minimize the impact on a specific population. Dengue EWS may have a similar structural design, functions, and analytical approaches but different performance and ability to predict outbreaks. Hence, this review aims to summarise and discuss the evidence of different EWSs, their performance, and their ability to predict dengue outbreaks. A systematic literature search was performed of four primary databases: Scopus, Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, and EBSCOhost. Eligible articles were evaluated using a checklist for assessing the quality of the studies. A total of 17 studies were included in this systematic review. All EWS models demonstrated reasonably good predictive abilities to predict dengue outbreaks. However, the accuracy of their predictions varied greatly depending on the model used and the data quality. The reported sensitivity ranged from 50 to 100\%, while specificity was 74 to 94.7\%. A range between 70 to 96.3\% was reported for prediction model accuracy and 43 to 86\% for PPV. Overall, meteorological alarm indicators (temperatures and rainfall) were the most frequently used and displayed the best performing indicator. Other potential alarm indicators are entomology (female mosquito infection rate), epidemiology, population and socioeconomic factors. EWS is an essential tool to support district health managers and national health planners to mitigate or prevent disease outbreaks. This systematic review highlights the benefits of integrating several epidemiological tools focusing on incorporating climatic, environmental, epidemiological and socioeconomic factors to create an early warning system. The early warning system relies heavily on the country surveillance system. The lack of timely and high-quality data is critical for developing an effective EWS.},

  abstract = {Dengue fever affects over a 100 million people annually hence is one of the world's most important vector-borne diseases. The transmission area of this disease continues to expand due to many direct and indirect factors linked to urban sprawl, increased travel and global warming. Current preventative measures include mosquito control programs, yet due to the complex nature of the disease and the increased importation risk along with the lack of efficient prophylactic measures, successful disease control and elimination is not realistic in the foreseeable future. Epidemiological models attempt to predict future outbreaks using information on the risk factors of the disease. Through a systematic literature review, this paper aims at analyzing the different modeling methods and their outputs in terms of acting as an early warning system. We found that many previous studies have not sufficiently accounted for the spatio-temporal features of the disease in the modeling process. Yet with advances in technology, the ability to incorporate such information as well as the socioenvironmental aspect allowed for its use as an early warning system, albeit limited geographically to a local scale.},

  abstract = {Recently, a prototype dengue early warning system was developed to produce probabilistic forecasts of dengue risk three months ahead of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Here, we evaluate the categorical dengue forecasts across all microregions in Brazil, using dengue cases reported in June 2014 to validate the model. We also compare the forecast model framework to a null model, based on seasonal averages of previously observed dengue incidence. When considering the ability of the two models to predict high dengue risk across Brazil, the forecast model produced more hits and fewer missed events than the null model, with a hit rate of 57\% for the forecast model compared to 33\% for the null model. This early warning model framework may be useful to public health services, not only ahead of mass gatherings, but also before the peak dengue season each year, to control potentially explosive dengue epidemics.           ,              Dengue is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes and is widespread in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Dengue epidemics in Brazil often occur without warning, and can overwhelm the public health services. Forecasts of seasonal climates combined with early data from a dengue surveillance system could help public health services anticipate dengue outbreaks several months in advance. However, this information has not been previously exploited to predict dengue epidemics in a practical real-life framework.             Recently, a group of researchers developed a prototype of a dengue early warning system based on 13 years worth of data, and used it to predict the risk of dengue three months ahead of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Now Lowe et al. -- including most of the researchers involved in the earlier work -- have evaluated the prototype against the actual reported cases of dengue during the event. Brazil is divided into over 550 'microregions', and the forecasts correctly predicted high risk of dengue for 57\% of the microregions reporting high levels of dengue during the games. Forecasts based on seasonal dengue averages would have only detected high risk in 33\% of these microregions. The forecasts also correctly predicted the dengue risk level in seven out of the twelve cities where the World Cup games were hosted. However, the prototype failed to predict the high risk in both S{\~a}o Paulo and Bras{\'i}lia. Lowe et al. speculate that this may have been due to changes in how water was stored in these cities (standing water is a breeding site for mosquitoes) and the circulation of a new strain of the dengue virus.             The implementation of seasonal climate forecasts and early reports of dengue cases into an early warning system is now a priority for public health authorities. This action is likely to help them to prepare for and minimize epidemics of dengue and other diseases that are spread by mosquitoes, such as chikungunya and Zika virus.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the potential for using seasonal climate forecasts in developing an early warning system for dengue fever epidemics in Brazil. In the first instance, a generalised linear model (GLM) is used to select climate and other covariates which are both readily available and prove significant in prediction of confirmed monthly dengue cases based on data collected across the whole of Brazil for the period January 2001 to December 2008 at the microregion level (typically consisting of one large city and several smaller municipalities). The covariates explored include temperature and precipitation data on a 2.5{$^\circ\times$}2.5{$^\circ$} longitude-latitude grid with time lags relevant to dengue transmission, an El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation index and other relevant socio-economic and environmental variables. A negative binomial model formulation is adopted in this model selection to allow for extra-Poisson variation (overdispersion) in the observed dengue counts caused by unknown/unobserved confounding factors and possible correlations in these effects in both time and space. Subsequently, the selected global model is refined in the context of the South East region of Brazil, where dengue predominates, by reverting to a Poisson framework and explicitly modelling the overdispersion through a combination of unstructured and spatio-temporal structured random effects. The resulting spatio-temporal hierarchical model (or GLMM-generalised linear mixed model) is implemented via a Bayesian framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Dengue predictions are found to be enhanced both spatially and temporally when using the GLMM and the Bayesian framework allows posterior predictive distributions for dengue cases to be derived, which can be useful for developing a dengue alert system. Using this model, we conclude that seasonal climate forecasts could have potential value in helping to predict dengue incidence months in advance of an epidemic in South East Brazil. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The frequency of infectious disease epidemics is increasing, and the role of the health sector in the management of epidemics is crucial in terms of response. In the context of infectious disease epidemics, the use of climate-informed early warning systems (EWS) has the potential to increase the effectiveness of disease control by intervening before or at the beginning of the epidemic curve, instead of during the downward slope. Currently, the initiation of interventions is heavily reliant on routine disease surveillance systems -- data that often arrive too late for preventative response. However, forecasting of disease outbreaks using surveillance and weather information shows promising potential -- there also remains further scope to examine seasonal climate forecasts. By combining these elements in new EWS based on computational models, it will be possible to improve both the timeliness and impact of disease control. The World Health Organization (WHO) is strengthening existing surveillance systems for infectious diseases to enable the development of more robust and timely EWS, which has resulted in the rapid development and innovation of EWS for disease outbreaks. The core elements of climate-informed EWS are to: (i) monitor environmental conditions; (ii) forecast high-risk conditions, initiate active surveillance; (iii) send alerts and communication; and (iv) establish a mechanism for early response. This guide aims to outline key technical and operational criteria surrounding the performance, application, implementation and effectiveness of EWS and to illustrate how an understanding of these issues can be used for the evaluation of EWS for multiple infectious disease outbreaks. This guidance is aimed at national authorities of infectious disease programmes and health information systems of ministries of health (MoH).},

  abstract = {Although previous research frequently indicates that climate factors impact dengue transmission, the results are inconsistent. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis highlights and address the complex global health problems towards the human-environment interface and the inter-relationship between these variables. For this purpose, four online electronic databases were searched to conduct a systematic assessment of published studies reporting the association between dengue cases and climate between 2010 and 2022. The meta-analysis was conducted using random effects to assess correlation, publication bias and heterogeneity. The final assess\- ment included eight studies for both systematic review and meta-analysis. A total of four meta-analyses were conducted to evaluate the correlation of dengue cases with climate variables, namely precipitation, temperature, minimum temperature and relative humidity. The highest correlation is observed for precipitation between 83 mm and 15 mm (r = 0.38, 95\% CI = 0.31, 0.45), relative humidity between 60.5\% and 88.7\% (r = 0.30, 95\% CI = 0.23, 0.37), minimum temperature between 6.5 {\textopenbullet}C and 21.4 {\textopenbullet}C (r = 0.28, 95\% CI = 0.05, 0.48) and mean temperature between 21.0 {\textopenbullet}C and 29.8 {\textopenbullet}C (r = 0.07, 95\% CI = - 0.1, 0.24). Thus, the influence of climate variables on the magnitude of dengue cases in terms of their distribution, frequency, and prevailing variables was established and conceptualised. The results of this meta-analysis enable multidisciplinary collaboration to improve dengue surveillance, epidemiology, and prevention programmes.},

  abstract = {Framed within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) of the European Commission, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is producing an enhanced global dataset for the land component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5), hereafter referred to as ERA5-Land. Once completed, the period covered will span from 1950 to the present, with continuous updates to support land monitoring applications. ERA5-Land describes the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the production period, which, among others, could be used to analyse trends and anomalies. This is achieved through global high-resolution numerical integrations of the ECMWF land surface model driven by the downscaled meteorological forcing from the ERA5 climate reanalysis, including an elevation correction for the thermodynamic near-surface state. ERA5-Land shares with ERA5 most of the parameterizations that guarantees the use of the state-of-the-art land surface modelling applied to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. A main advantage of ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 and the older ERA-Interim is the horizontal resolution, which is enhanced globally to 9{\^g}{\texteuro}{\textasciimacron}km compared to 31{\^g}{\texteuro}{\textasciimacron}km (ERA5) or 80{\^g}{\texteuro}{\textasciimacron}km (ERA-Interim), whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in ERA5. Evaluation against independent in situ observations and global model or satellite-based reference datasets shows the added value of ERA5-Land in the description of the hydrological cycle, in particular with enhanced soil moisture and lake description, and an overall better agreement of river discharge estimations with available observations. However, ERA5-Land snow depth fields present a mixed performance when compared to those of ERA5, depending on geographical location and altitude. The description of the energy cycle shows comparable results with ERA5. Nevertheless, ERA5-Land reduces the global averaged root mean square error of the skin temperature, taking as reference MODIS data, mainly due to the contribution of coastal points where spatial resolution is important. Since January 2020, the ERA5-Land period available has extended from January 1981 to the near present, with a 2- to 3-month delay with respect to real time. The segment prior to 1981 is in production, aiming for a release of the whole dataset in summer/autumn 2021. The high spatial and temporal resolution of ERA5-Land, its extended period, and the consistency of the fields produced makes it a valuable dataset to support hydrological studies, to initialize NWP and climate models, and to support diverse applications dealing with water resource, land, and environmental management. The full ERA5-Land hourly and monthly averaged datasets presented in this paper are available through the C3S Climate Data Store at https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.e2161bac and https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.68d2bb30, respectively.},

In the absence of a universal vaccine or specific treatments, prevention relies on vector control and disease surveillance. Accurate and early forecasts can help reduce the spread of the disease. In this study, we developed a model for predicting monthly dengue cases in Brazilian cities 1 month ahead, using data from 2007-2019. We compared different machine learning algorithms and feature selection methods using epidemiologic and meteorological variables. We found that different models worked best in different cities, and a random forests model trained on monthly dengue cases performed best overall. It produced lower errors than a seasonal naive baseline model, gradient boosting regression, a feed-forward neural network, or support vector regression. For each city, we computed the mean absolute error between predictions and true monthly numbers of dengue cases on the test data set. The median error across all cities was 12.2 cases. This error was reduced to 11.9 when selecting the optimal combination of algorithm and input features for each city individually. Machine learning and especially decision tree ensemble models may contribute to dengue surveillance in Brazil, as they produce low out-of-sample prediction errors for a geographically diverse set of cities.},

Currently, there is no effective vaccine to combat all serology of the virus. Therefore, the fight against the disease turns to preventive measures against the proliferation of the mosquito. Researchers are using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) as tools to predict cases of dengue and help governments in this fight. Objective: to identify which ML and DL techniques and approaches are being used to predict dengue. Methods: systematic review carried out on the bases of the areas of Medicine and Computing in order to answer the research questions: it is possible to make predictions of dengue cases using ML and DL techniques, which techniques are used, where the studies are being performed, how and what data is being used? Results: after performing the searches, applying the inclusion, exclusion and in-depth reading criteria, 14 articles were approved. The Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) techniques are present in 85\% of the works. Regarding the data, most were used 10 years of historical data on the disease and climate information. Finally, the Root Mean Absolute Error (RMSE) technique was preferred to measure the error. Conclusion: the review showed the feasibility of using ML and DL techniques to predict dengue cases, with a low error rate and validated through statistical techniques.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a short overview of space--time series clustering, which can be generally grouped into three main categories such as: hierarchical, partitioning-based, and overlapping clustering. The first hierarchical category is to identify hierarchies in space--time series data. The second partitioning-based category focuses on determining disjoint partitions among the space--time series data, whereas the third overlapping category explores fuzzy logic to determine the different correlations between the space--time series clusters. We also further describe solutions for each category in this paper. Furthermore, we show the applications of these solutions in an urban traffic data captured on two urban smart cities (e.g., Odense in Denmark and Beijing in China). The perspectives on open questions and research challenges are also mentioned and discussed that allow to obtain a better understanding of the intuition, limitations, and benefits for the various space--time series clustering methods. This work can thus provide the guidances to practitioners for selecting the most suitable methods for their used cases, domains, and applications.},

In practice, health information systems rarely function systematically. The products of historical, social and economic forces, they are complex, fragmented and unresponsive to needs. International donors in health are largely responsible for the problem, having prioritized urgent needs for data over longer-term country capacity-building. The result is painfully apparent in the inability of most countries to generate the data needed to monitor progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. Solutions to the problem must be comprehensive; money alone is likely to be insufficient unless accompanied by sustained support to country systems development coupled with greater donor accountability and allocation of responsibilities. The Health Metrics Network, a global collaboration in the making, is intended to help bring such solutions to the countries most in need.},

Long available only through antiquarian bookstores, A History of Public Health now returns to print in a paperback edition that supplements the original text with Elizabeth Fee's new introduction and Edward T. Morman's biographical essay and bibliography. George Rosen discusses the evolution of public health in classical Greece, imperial Rome, England, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, the United States, and other countries. He also presents the lives and history-making contributions of the great figures in public health. Approaching the subject from a broad point of view, Rosen considers community health problems of different periods in terms of their political, social, and economic patterns. Among the topics discussed are the prevalence of disease, the water supply and sewage disposal, epidemiological theory, maternal and child health, nutrition, occupational health, health education, public health administration, communicable disease control, medical care, statistics, public policy, and medical geography. A new introduction by Elizabeth Fee places the work in the context of both the earlier and later historiography of public health. Fee identifies Rosen's agenda in relation to trends in medical history and the politics of public health in the 1950s. She also assesses the impact of Rosen's book and identifies new problems in public health that have arisen since its first publication.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Google Flu Trends (GFT) uses anonymized, aggregated internet search activity to provide near-real time estimates of influenza activity. GFT estimates have shown a strong correlation with official influenza surveillance data. The 2009 influenza virus A (H1N1) pandemic [pH1N1] provided the first opportunity to evaluate GFT during a non-seasonal influenza outbreak. In September 2009, an updated United States GFT model was developed using data from the beginning of pH1N1.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We evaluated the accuracy of each U.S. GFT model by comparing weekly estimates of ILI (influenza-like illness) activity with the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet). For each GFT model we calculated the correlation and RMSE (root mean square error) between model estimates and ILINet for four time periods: pre-H1N1, Summer H1N1, Winter H1N1, and H1N1 overall (Mar 2009-Dec 2009). We also compared the number of queries, query volume, and types of queries (e.g., influenza symptoms, influenza complications) in each model. Both models' estimates were highly correlated with ILINet pre-H1N1 and over the entire surveillance period, although the original model underestimated the magnitude of ILI activity during pH1N1. The updated model was more correlated with ILINet than the original model during Summer H1N1 (r{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.95 and 0.29, respectively). The updated model included more search query terms than the original model, with more queries directly related to influenza infection, whereas the original model contained more queries related to influenza complications.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Internet search behavior changed during pH1N1, particularly in the categories "influenza complications" and "term for influenza." The complications associated with pH1N1, the fact that pH1N1 began in the summer rather than winter, and changes in health-seeking behavior each may have played a part. Both GFT models performed well prior to and during pH1N1, although the updated model performed better during pH1N1, especially during the summer months.},

  abstract = {This article examines the strategy for construction of a System of Indicators for Monitoring the Public Policies and Health Situation of the Elderly (SISAP-Idoso). The System seeks to assess the production of health information with the political/institutional decision, serving as a management tool in the health of the elderly. Its focus is to meet the need of the Unified Health System municipal managers for information for planning and controlling health programs. The paper presents the methods used in the creation of the Conceptual Matrix for Health Dimensions and Conceptual Matrix for Monitoring and Evaluation of Policies. The first systematizes a panel of indicators to diagnose the health condition of the elderly, a procedure without which one cannot properly plan health actions. The second selects indicators to monitor implementation and evaluate the results of health policies and programs for the elderly. The System became an important tool to support the formulation and monitoring of health programs, particularly at the local level. Moreover, it is a powerful tool of social control and population empowerment. The full incorporation of the System depends on the consolidation of information and indicators as parts of the policy process.},

Coverage of the data by municipality was estimated as the ratio between reported and estimated live births. Data quality in the SINASC was assessed via probabilistic linkage with the database from the Birth in Brazil study, 2011-2012, and kappa coefficients of agreement were calculated. In 2013, data coverage was high and homogeneous in all states of Brazil. However, the analysis according to municipalities (counties) showed greater spatial heterogeneity. As for completeness of information in SINASC, kappa coefficients were statistically different from zero for all the tested variables (p {$<$} 0.001), and marginal distributions of all the variables were similar in the two databases. Gestational age was the variable with the worst agreement, with a kappa value of 0.461. The indicator that describes the inconsistencies, measured by the sum of the square of the differences between the reported and expected prematurity rates by birthweight bracket, showed the highest value in the North of Brazil and the lowest in the South, pointing to geographic inequalities in measurement of gestational age.},

Abstract This paper aims to introduce and raise interest on time series analysis in epidemiological studies. Conceptual aspects are described and methodological guidelines for this type of analysis are systematized. We defined the key concepts of time series analysis (trends, seasonal and cyclical variation, association and random variation), and how they can be applied to epidemiology. Methods to assess trends (annual percent change), based on Prais-Winsten regression models, and to quantify seasonal variation (Serfling model) were presented. We also introduced segmented regression analysis for interrupted time series, as a strategy for assessing effects of health interventions.},

Variables in an ecologic analysis may be aggregate measures, environmental measures, or global measures. The purpose of an ecologic analysis may be to make biologic inferences about effects on individual risks or to make ecologic inferences about effects on group rates. Ecologic study designs may be classified on two dimensions: (a) whether the primary group is measured (exploratory vs analytic study); and (b) whether subjects are grouped by place (multiple-group study), by time (time-trend study), or by place and time (mixed study). Despite several practical advantages of ecologic studies, there are many methodologic problems that severely limit causal inference, including ecologic and cross-level bias, problems of confounder control, within-group misclassification, lack of adequate data, temporal ambiguity, collinearity, and migration across groups.},

  abstract = {The capabilities for uisualization, rapid data retrieval, and manipulation in geographic informution systems (GIS) have created the need for new techniques of exploratory data analysis that focus on the ``spatial'' aspects of the data. The identifcation of local patterns of spatial assocktion is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G: statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identifiy ``outliers,'' as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial eualuation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of confict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations},

In contrast, tests for the detection of clusters are concerned with screening a large region for evidence of individual `hot spots' of disease but without any preconception about their likely locations; the results of such tests may form the basis for subsequent small area investigations, statistical or non-statistical, but will rarely be an end in themselves. The main intention of the paper is to describe and illustrate a new technique for the identification of small clusters of disease. A secondary purpose is to discuss some common pitfalls in the application of tests of clustering to epidemiological data.}

It is both a methodological tool and a theoretical paradigm that allows us to pose and answer important ecological questions in public health. In this review we trace the history of network analysis, provide a methodological overview of network techniques, and discuss where and how network analysis has been used in public health. We show how network analysis has its roots in mathematics, statistics, sociology, anthropology, psychology, biology, physics, and computer science. In public health, network analysis has been used to study primarily disease transmission, especially for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases; information transmission, particularly for diffusion of innovations; the role of social support and social capital; the influence of personal and social networks on health behavior; and the interorganizational structure of health systems. We conclude with future directions for network analysis in public health.},

  abstract = {TheEncyclopedia of Social Network Analysis and Mining (ESNAM) is the first major reference work to integrate fundamental concepts and research directions in the areas of social networks and applications to data mining. This set of comprehensive and authoritative volumes {$\bullet$} explains the science and technology behind the rapidly growing global avenues for exchanging views and influencing others {$\bullet$} presents the first comprehensive coverage of all fields that contribute to social network construction and analysis as a multidisciplinary domain {$\bullet$} is designed to appeal to an interdisciplinary audience ranging from the undergraduate to professional level {$\bullet$} describes social network applications to knowledge mining and discovery {$\bullet$} addresses privacy, security, ethical, and civil liberty issues for social networks. While ESNAM reflects the state-of-the-art in social network research, the field had its start in the 1930s when fundamental issues in social network research were broadly defined. These communities were limited to relatively small numbers of nodes (actors) and links. More recently the advent of electronic communication, and in particular on-line communities, have created social networks of hitherto unimaginable sizes. People around the world are directly or indirectly connected by popular social networks established using web-based platforms rather than by physical proximity. Reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of this unique field, the essential contributions of diverse disciplines, from computer science, mathematics, and statistics to sociology and behavioral science, are described among the 300 authoritative yet highly readable entries. Students will find a world of information and insight behind the familiar fa{\c c}ade of the social networks in which they participate. Researchers and practitioners will benefit from a comprehensive perspective on the methodologies for analysis of constructed networks, and the data mining and machine learning techniques that have proved attractive for sophisticated knowledge discovery in complex applications. Also addressed is the application of social network methodologies to other domains, such as web networks and biological networks.},

  abstract = {Relationships and the pattern of relationships have a large and varied influence on both individual and group action. The fundamental distinction of social network analysis research is that relationships are of paramount importance in explaining behavior. Because of this, social network analysis offers many exciting tools and techniques for research and practice in a wide variety of medical and public health situations including organizational improvements, understanding risk behaviors, coordinating coalitions, and the delivery of health care services. This book provides an introduction to the major theories, methods, models, and findings of social network analysis research and application. In three sections, it presents a comprehensive overview of the topic; first in a survey of its historical and theoretical foundations, then in practical descriptions of the variety of methods currently in use, and finally in a discussion of its specific applications for behavior change in a public health context. Throughout, the text has been kept clear, concise, and comprehensible, with short mathematical formulas for some key indicators or concepts. Researchers and students alike will find it an invaluable resource for understanding and implementing social network analysis in their own practice.},

Through these processes, the results obtained by the analysis of indicators are sensitive to the choice of indicators, information sources, scale of analysis, spatial reference units and methods of spatial analysis. The objective of this work is to define the role of spatial analysis in the health situation assessment, which includes the description of the epidemiological profiles, quality of life and environmental conditions. The first step for characterizing the health situation is to describe the structure and spatial dynamics of the population. Spatial analysis permits the planning of control actions and resource allocation as it allows to describe and understand the social and enviromental processes in which health events occur.},

The objective of this article is to present an overview of the evolution of the pandemic in the country according to the bulletins of the Covid-19 Fiocruz Observatory in the period between the declarations of the beginning and end of the Public Health Emergency of National Concern (ESPIN, in Portuguese), February 2020 to April 2022. Several of the indicators adopted in the 69 bulletins published for the analysis of the pandemic were used, such as cases and deaths due to SARIs and COVID-19, age groups, \% of occupancy of ICU beds, and vaccination, among others. The evolution analysis was organized between years and phases of the pandemic, seeking to highlight what characterized each moment. The closing statement of ESPIN in Brazil coincides with the discussions on the transition from a pandemic to an endemic scenario, without this representing the elimination of the virus, infections, and disease, posing the challenges of advances in vaccination processes in Brazil and around the world, as well as living with scenarios that may require the adoption of temporary protection measures in epidemic periods and periods of greater risk for vulnerable groups.},

Objective To reflect on the possible changes that data science can induce in population and health related studies. Method To foster this debate, scientific articles selected from the big data field in health and demography were contrasted with books and other scientific productions. Results It is argued that volume is not the most promising characteristic of big data for population and health related studies, but rather the complexity of data and the possibilities of integration with traditional studies by means of interdisciplinary teams. Conclusion In population and health related studies, the possibilities of integration between new and traditional methods are broad, and include new toolboxes for analysis, monitoring, prediction of events (cases) and health-disease processes in the population, and for the study of sociodemographic and environmental determinants.},

  abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In 'The Future of Data Analysis', he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or 'data analysis'. Ten to twenty years ago, John Chambers, Bill Cleveland and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland even suggested the catchy name "Data Science" for his envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon is the emergence of "Data Science" programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most recently the Univ. of Michigan, which on September 8, 2015 announced a \$100M "Data Science Initiative" that will hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; in general, though, the new initiatives steer away from close involvement with academic statistics departments. This paper reviews some ingredients of the current "Data Science moment", including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether Data Science is really different from Statistics. The now-contemplated field of Data Science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning which adds some technology for 'scaling up' to 'big data'. This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next fifty years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in Data Science is not about mere 'scaling up', but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are 'learning from data', and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today's Data Science Initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals.},

In many disciplines there is near-exclusive use of statistical mod-eling for causal explanation and the assumption that models with high explanatory power are inherently of high predictive power. Conflation between explanation and prediction is common, yet the distinction must be understood for progressing scientific knowledge. While this distinction has been recognized in the philosophy of science, the statis-tical literature lacks a thorough discussion of the many differences that arise in the process of modeling for an explanatory versus a predictive goal. The purpose of this article is to clarify the distinction between explanatory and predictive modeling, to discuss its sources, and to re-veal the practical implications of the distinction to each step in the modeling process.},

The framework presents a set of pathways that combine the data-driven and theory-driven perspectives. From these pathways, we derive a set of challenges, and show how they can be addressed by research in information systems. By doing so, we identify an important role that information systems research can play in advancing both data-driven and theory-driven research in the era of big data.},

The basic goal of Health Informatics is to take in real world medical data from all levels of human existence to help advance our understanding of medicine and medical practice. This paper will present recent research using Big Data tools and approaches for the analysis of Health Informatics data gathered at multiple levels, including the molecular, tissue, patient, and population levels. In addition to gathering data at multiple levels, multiple levels of questions are addressed: human-scale biology, clinical-scale, and epidemic-scale. We will also analyze and examine possible future work for each of these areas, as well as how combining data from each level may provide the most promising approach to gain the most knowledge in Health Informatics.},

While these ``big data'' have unlocked novel opportunities to understand public health, they hold still greater potential for research and practice. This review explores several key issues that have arisen around big data. First, we propose a taxonomy of sources of big data to clarify terminology and identify threads common across some subtypes of big data. Next, we consider common public health research and practice uses for big data, including surveillance, hypothesis-generating research, and causal inference, while exploring the role that machine learning may play in each use. We then consider the ethical implications of the big data revolution with particular emphasis on maintaining appropriate care for privacy in a world in which technology is rapidly changing social norms regarding the need for (and even the meaning of) privacy. Finally, we make suggestions regarding structuring teams and training to succeed in working with big data in research and practice.},

Such reforms attempt to increase the data subjects' privacy op-tions and introduce further controls on data uses. However, the control of access to data needs to cover not only data pro-tection, but also the distribution of any benefits of the exploitation of personal data and the public acceptability of such exploitation. 10 Provisions for fair benefit sharing need to form an integral part of any policies on data access. Such policies need to be citizen-centric. Citizens are increasingly demanding access to their own data, partly to control the second-ary uses of the data and partly to use the data themselves. 11 Technology, such as the internet can facilitate public access to health data and citizens who seek such information online can provide useful indicators of emerging health threats. 12 Citizens are important stakeholders in the development, evaluation, implemen-tation and monitoring of data initiatives. Their role should extend far beyond the provision of informed consent for data use and include involvement in the governance of data initiatives and negotiations on the fair sharing of the benefits of data exploitation.

Abstract The use of big data has increased in recent years in all scientific areas. There are currently three promising areas for the use of big data in healthcare: precision medicine, electronic medical records and the internet of things. Two programming languages have gained momentum in data science: R and Python. Regarding the statistical techniques, it is expected that machine learning (especially classification and regression trees), methodologies for controlling spu-rious associations (such as Bonferroni correction and false discovery rate) and methodologies for dimension reduction (such as principal components analysis and propensity scores) will be increasingly used. Privacy is an issue that will become ever more important in data analysis. The use of big data in healthcare will bring enormous gains in terms of costs, time and lives saved, and needs to be actively defended by data scientists and epidemiologists.},

  abstract = {Abstract The last 6~years have seen sustained investment in health data science in the United Kingdom and beyond, which should result in a data science community that is inclusive of all stakeholders, working together to use data to benefit society through the improvement of public health and well-being. However, opportunities made possible through the innovative use of data are still not being fully realised, resulting in research inefficiencies and avoidable health harms. In this paper, we identify the most important barriers to achieving higher productivity in health data science. We then draw on previous research, domain expertise, and theory to outline how to go about overcoming these barriers, applying our core values of inclusivity and transparency. We believe a step change can be achieved through meaningful stakeholder involvement at every stage of research planning, design, and execution and team-based data science, as well as harnessing novel and secure data technologies. Applying these values to health data science will safeguard a social licence for health data research and ensure transparent and secure data usage for public benefit.},

First, the rhetoric of health is analysed in historical perspective, briefly considering the main elements of the discourse of the ideological movements that historically built the social field of health. Medical Police, Social Medicine and Public Health are included as representative of such movements in 19th century Western Europe. After the Flexnerian turn, these movements were followed by Preventive Medicine, Community Health, Primary Health Care and Health Promotion, which dominated the scene particularly in the second half of the 20th century. The authors also summarise recent concerted PAHO efforts to debate the theory and practice of Public Health in the Americas, vis {\`a} vis the emerging demands of the economic, political and social context of Latin American countries. In this regard, the need for a common political agenda is emphasized , with the convergence of three topics - sectorial reform, "Renovation of Health for All" and the "new public health", covering the conceptual, methodological and operative domains. Secondly, a brief systematic account of the conceptual landmarks of the Collective Health movement, as carried through in the two last decades in Latin America, is presented, focusing more particularly on its potential for building up both a domain of transdisciplinary knowledge and a universe of practices. As a field of knowledge, it contributes to the study of health-disease phenomena in populations as a social process, investigating the production and distribution of disease in society as an aspect of social reproduction, and analysing health practices as a labor process integrated into the other social practices. As a universe of practices, Collective Health focuses on its models or action guidelines four objects of intervention: policies (forms of power distribution); practices (behavior modification; culture; institutions; knowledge production; institutional, professional and relational practices); technologies (organization and regulation of productive resources and processes; bodies/environments), and instruments (means of production of interventions). Finally, it is concluded that, although not being in itself a paradigm, Collective Health, as a movement committed to the social transformation of health, presents some possibilities of articulation with new scientific paradigms capable of approaching the health-disease-care object with due regard to its historicity and complexity.},

Despite these ambiguities, most would agree that Big Data and the methods for analyzing it represent a remarkable potential for advancing social science knowledge. In my Presidential address to the Southern Demographic Association, I argue that demographers have long collected and analyzed Big Data in a small way, by parsing out the points of information that we can manipulate with familiar models and restricting analyses to what typical computing systems can handle or restricted-access data disseminators will allow. In order to better interrogate the data we already have, we need to change the culture of demography to treat demographic microdata as Big. This includes shaping the definition of Big Data, changing how we conceptualize models, and re-evaluating how we silo confidential data.},

  abstract = {Increases in international funding for health have been accompanied by accelerating demand for more and better statistics, which are needed to track performance and ensure accountability. Worldwide interest in the monitoring of development, as exemplified in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), generates pressure for high-quality and timely data for reporting on country progress. This rapid escalation of demand has exposed major gaps in the supply of health statistics for developing countries but also provides major opportunities to increase the supply and use of sound health statistics. First, the emphasis on monitoring and evaluation is leading to proliferation of indicators and excessive reporting requirements, and needs to be refocused on systematic investments in data generation and analysis. Second, the risk of inadequate or poorly targeted investments can be kept to a minimum by understanding the causes of poor availability of health statistics, including lack of accurate measurement instruments, application of suboptimum methods of data collection, and inadequate use of methods and analyses to produce comparable estimates. Third, the preoccupation with MDGs does not take into account the rapid health transition, which implies that health statistics should systematically include a much wider array of health issues from acute infectious diseases to chronic non-communicable diseases and injuries, disaggregated by socioeconomic position. Fourth, the growing number of national household surveys, which are the main source of most population health statistics, need to be streamlined into cohesive and comprehensive country health survey programmes. Now is the time to accelerate the production and use of accurate, complete, and timely health statistics for decision-making by investing in country health information systems that should be based on an efficient and effective mix of standardised methods of data collection and analysis that meet country and international needs.},

In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare `the end of theory', the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society. It is argued that: (1) Big Data and new data analytics are disruptive innovations which are reconfiguring in many instances how research is conducted; and (2) there is an urgent need for wider critical reflection within the academy on the epistemological implications of the unfolding data revolution, a task that has barely begun to be tackled despite the rapid changes in research practices presently taking place. After critically reviewing emerging epistemological positions, it is contended that a potentially fruitful approach would be the development of a situated, reflexive and contextually nuanced epistemology.},

Since they now touch on many aspects of our lives, it is crucial to develop ML algorithms that are not only accurate but also objective and fair. Recent studies have shown that algorithmic decision making may be inherently prone to unfairness, even when there is no intention for it. This article presents an overview of the main concepts of identifying, measuring, and improving algorithmic fairness when using ML algorithms, focusing primarily on classification tasks. The article begins by discussing the causes of algorithmic bias and unfairness and the common definitions and measures for fairness. Fairness-enhancing mechanisms are then reviewed and divided into pre-process, in-process, and post-process mechanisms. A comprehensive comparison of the mechanisms is then conducted, toward a better understanding of which mechanisms should be used in different scenarios. The article ends by reviewing several emerging research sub-fields of algorithmic fairness, beyond classification.},

Big data has been successfully used in astronomy (eg, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey of telescopic information), retail sales (eg, Walmart's expansive number of transactions), search engines (eg, Google's customization of individual searches based on previous web data), and politics (eg, a campaign's focus of political advertisements on people most likely to support their candidate based on web searches).},

Objective Investigate the association between FHL and socio-demographic factors, social support, self-assessment of health status and access to health services in women assisted by the Family Health Strategy (FHS). Method A cross-sectional study, conducted in 2015-2016, in two Primary Health Care Units covered by the FHS of a municipality in the Southeast region of Brazil. The sample consisted of 479 participants, aged between 24 and 64 years. FHL was evaluated by the Brief Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (B-TOFHLA). Prevalence Ratio (PR), with Confidence Interval (CI) of 95\%, was performed. Subsequently, a Poisson regression model of robust variance was constructed, and statistical significance was accepted when p{$\leq$}0.05. Results It was found that 53.5\% of the women had a low FHL, which was associated with age over 40 (RP = 1.18, 95\% CI: 1.07-1.31), low education level (RP = 1.26, 95\% CI: 1.15-1.38), low income (RP = 1.13, 95\% CI 1.04-1.23) and self-declaration brown or black skin color (PR = 1.06, 95\% CI 1.01-1.12). Conclusion The results reinforce the importance of FHL use as a strategy for the management of populations with greater socioeconomic vulnerability.},

  abstract = {Background{\enspace} Low polio vaccine coverage can result in the spread of Poliovirus to areas free from viral circulation. This study analyzed the temporal trends and spatial distribution of polio vaccine coverage in one year-old children in Brazil, between 2011 and 2021. Methods: This was an ecological, time-series study (2011 to 2021) with annual vaccine coverages against poliomyelitis, extracted from the Information System of the National Immunization Program from the 26 States and the Distrito Federal (DF). The percentage reductions in vaccination coverage in Brazil and in the Regions were calculated. Prais-Winsten regression models were used to analyze time series for the Regions and States, and spatial analysis identified the distribution of clusters (high-high; low-low; high-low and low-high) of vaccination coverages across Brazilian municipalities, using a 5\% significance level. Results: From 2011 to 2021, the coverage of polio vaccines decreased by 29,9\%. There was a progressive increase observed in clusters resulting in low vaccination coverages (140 low-low Brazilian municipalities in 2011 vs. 403 in 2021), mostly reported in the North and Northeast regions of the country. There was a downward trend in vaccination coverages in 24 of the 26 States and DF (p\,{$\leq$}\,0.05). Conclusions: The reduction in polio vaccine coverage, as observed in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, may favor the spread of Poliovirus. Therefore, vaccination strategies should be prioritized for children residing in areas with sharp and recurrent declines in vaccination coverages, including travelers, migrants, and refugees. Highlights {$\bullet$} Clusters with low coverage of the poliovirus vaccine were concentrated in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil; {$\bullet$} Poliomyelitis vaccination strategies in Brazil should be directed, in particular, to areas that present a marked and continuous decrease in vaccine coverage; {$\bullet$} Travelers, migrants and refugees should also be included in polio vaccination strategies in Brazil.},

  abstract = {Disease surveillance is used to monitor ongoing control activities, detect early outbreaks, and inform intervention priorities and policies. However, data from disease surveillance that could be used to support real-time decisionmaking remain largely underutilised. Using the Brazilian Amazon malaria surveillance dataset as a case study, in this paper we explore the potential for unsupervised anomaly detection machine learning techniques to discover signals of epidemiological interest. We found that our models were able to provide an early indication of outbreak onset, outbreak peaks, and change points in the proportion of positive malaria cases. Specifically, the sustained rise in malaria in the Brazilian Amazon in 2016 was flagged by several models. We found that no single model detected all anomalies across all health regions. Because of this, we provide the minimum number of machine learning models top-k models) to maximise the number of anomalies detected across different health regions. We discovered that the top three models that maximise the coverage of the number and types of anomalies detected across the thirteen health regions are principal component analysis, stochastic outlier selection, and the minimum covariance determinant. Anomaly detection is a potentially valuable approach to discovering patterns of epidemiological importance when confronted with a large volume of data across space and time. Our exploratory approach can be replicated for other diseases and locations to inform monitoring, timely interventions, and actions towards the goal of controlling endemic disease.},

The algorithm i) is built around a 0.05{$^\circ$} climatology that incorporates satellite information to represent sparsely gauged locations, ii) incorporates daily, pentadal, and monthly 1981-present 0.05{$^\circ$} CCD-based precipitation estimates, iii) blends station data to produce a preliminary information product with a latency of about 2 days and a final product with an average latency of about 3 weeks, and iv) uses a novel blending procedure incorporating the spatial correlation structure of CCD-estimates to assign interpolation weights. We present the CHIRPS algorithm, global and regional validation results, and show how CHIRPS can be used to quantify the hydrologic impacts of decreasing precipitation and rising air temperatures in the Greater Horn of Africa. Using the Variable Infiltration Capacity model, we show that CHIRPS can support effective hydrologic forecasts and trend analyses in southeastern Ethiopia.},

  abstract = {Abstract                          There is an increasing need for high spatial and temporal resolution climate data for the wide community of researchers interested in climate change and its consequences. Currently, there is a large mismatch between the spatial resolutions of global climate model and reanalysis datasets (at best around 0.25{$^\circ$} and 0.1{$^\circ$} respectively) and the resolutions needed by many end-users of these datasets, which are typically on the scale of 30 arcseconds ({$\sim$}900 m). This need for improved spatial resolution in climate datasets has motivated several groups to statistically downscale various combinations of observational or reanalysis datasets. However, the variety of downscaling methods and inputs used makes it difficult to reconcile the resultant differences between these high-resolution datasets. Here we make use of the KrigR R-package to statistically downscale the world-leading ERA5(-Land) reanalysis data using kriging. We show that kriging can accurately recover spatial heterogeneity of climate data given strong relationships with co-variates; that by preserving the uncertainty associated with the statistical downscaling, one can investigate and account for confidence in high-resolution climate data; and that the statistical uncertainty provided by KrigR can explain much of the difference between widely used high resolution climate datasets (CHELSA, TerraClimate, and WorldClim2) depending on variable, timescale, and region. This demonstrates the advantages of using KrigR to generate customized high spatial and/or temporal resolution climate data.},

  abstract = {Citizen science enlists the public in collecting large quantities of data across an array of habitats and locations over long spans of time. Citizen science projects have been remarkably successful in advancing scientific knowledge, and contributions from citizen scientists now provide a vast quantity of data about species occurrence and distribution around the world. Most citizen science projects also strive to help participants learn about the organisms they are observing and to experience the process by which scientific investigations are conducted. Developing and implementing public data-collection projects that yield both scientific and educational outcomes requires significant effort. This article describes the model for building and operating citizen science projects that has evolved at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology over the past two decades. We hope that our model will inform the fields of biodiversity monitoring, biological research, and science education while providing a window into the culture of citizen science.},

There is some evidence from both simulations and empirical studies supporting the likely effectiveness of these measures, but their broad adoption by researchers, institutions, funders and journals will require iterative evaluation and improvement. We discuss the goals of these measures, and how they can be implemented, in the hope that this will facilitate action toward improving the transparency, reproducibility and efficiency of scientific research.},

  abstract = {Data, code, and workflows should be available and cited           ,                             Over the past two decades, computational methods have radically changed the ability of researchers from all areas of scholarship to process and analyze data and to simulate complex systems. But with these advances come challenges that are contributing to broader concerns over irreproducibility in the scholarly literature, among them the lack of transparency in disclosure of computational methods. Current reporting methods are often uneven, incomplete, and still evolving. We present a novel set of Reproducibility Enhancement Principles (REP) targeting disclosure challenges involving computation. These recommendations, which build upon more general proposals from the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines (                                1                              ) and recommendations for field data (                                2                              ), emerged from workshop discussions among funding agencies, publishers and journal editors, industry participants, and researchers representing a broad range of domains. Although some of these actions may be aspirational, we believe it is important to recognize and move toward ameliorating irreproducibility in computational research.},

  abstract = {Background: Scientific research in the 21st century is more data intensive and collaborative than in the past. It is important to study the data practices of researchers -- data accessibility, discovery, re-use, preservation and, particularly, data sharing. Data sharing is a valuable part of the scientific method allowing for verification of results and extending research from prior results. Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 1329 scientists participated in this survey exploring current data sharing practices and perceptions of the barriers and enablers of data sharing. Scientists do not make their data electronically available to others for various reasons, including insufficient time and lack of funding. Most respondents are satisfied with their current processes for the initial and short-term parts of the data or research lifecycle (collecting their research data; searching for, describing or cataloging, analyzing, and short-term storage of their data) but are not satisfied with long-term data preservation. Many organizations do not provide support to their researchers for data management both in the shortand long-term. If certain conditions are met (such as formal citation and sharing reprints) respondents agree they are willing to share their data. There are also significant differences and approaches in data management practices based on primary funding agency, subject discipline, age, work focus, and world region. Conclusions/Significance: Barriers to effective data sharing and preservation are deeply rooted in the practices and culture of the research process as well as the researchers themselves. New mandates for data management plans from NSF and other federal agencies and world-wide attention to the need to share and preserve data could lead to changes. Large scale programs, such as the NSF-sponsored DataNET (including projects like DataONE) will both bring attention and resources to the issue and make it easier for scientists to apply sound data management principles.},

Open Science brings about socio-cultural and technological change, based on openness and connectivity, on how research is designed, performed, captured, and assessed. Several studies show that there is a lack of awareness about what Open Science is, mainly due to the fact that there is no formal definition of Open Science. The purpose of this paper is to build a rigorous, integrated, and up-to-date definition of the Open Science phenomenon through a systematic literature review. The resulting definition ``Open Science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks'' helps the scientific community, the business world, political actors, and citizens to have a common and clear understanding about what Open Science is, and stimulates an open debate about the social, economic, and human added value of this phenomenon.},
